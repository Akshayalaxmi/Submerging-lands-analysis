# Submerging-lands-analysis-
This project deal with the decade wise analysis of the rate of lands submerging at coastal areas of 188 countries. Approximate calculations of rate of coastal areas 
are taken in to the analysis. The countries are made into groups according to the rate of land submerging at higher rate or medium rate or lower rate. The top 5 countries are 
displayed whose lands are submerging at higher rate.The following analysis tasks are performed:
1.Analysis of correlation between global average temperature and change in Global mean sea level.
2.Analysis of correlation between temperature and change in mass balance of glaciers.
3. Anaysis of correlation between Sea level rise and glaciers mass balance change.
4.Clustering of countires based on the rate of land submergence.
5.Visualizing top 5 countires according to the land submergence rate.
